# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to help others with understanding prework. It was built for others also to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git from scratch; just like I did. It is easy to get flustered when learning to code from a random point; this study guide provides a straightforward approach for any future developers wanting to learn these topics. While building this study guide, I learned how to effectively format code for easier readability for both end users and collaborators.
